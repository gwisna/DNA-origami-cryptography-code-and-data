The cuboctahedron\_3D\_clustering\_and\_alignment\_4\_2.m is a matlab file that will do the 3D clustering, template alignment and decoding for 3D DNA origami cuboctahedron picks.

To run the code, download cuboctahedron\_3D\_clustering\_and\_alignment\_4\_2.m and the HDF5 file of 4\_2\_cuboctahedron\_DNA-PAINT.hdf5 and 4\_2\_cuboctahedron\_DNA-PAINT.yaml.
Place them in the same folder. Then open the .m file.
Run in Matlab. The code has been tested with Matlab R2022a and R2019 with phased\_array\_system\_toolbox, signal\_blocks, signal\_toolbox and statistics\_toolbox installed. The results are presented as part of Figure 5C, D, and 5E.

The  cuboctahedron\_3D\_clustering\_and\_alignment\_4\_2.m code runs the 4\_2\_cuboctahedron\_DNA-PAINT.hdf5 that contains 185 picks within 38 minutes on an Alienware Desktop Computer with an Intel Core i7-6800K CPU, 32 GB RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. The code should also run in normal desktop with expected longer time than mentioned above. No additional non-standard hardware is required.
